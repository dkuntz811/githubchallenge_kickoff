#Git Hub Challenge Goals

For my github challenge I will be reinforcing my JavaScript and jQuery skills because they still need to be developed. I will be updating existing Prime assignments that are incomplete or need updating. 

If after I feel like I have a better handle on these two languages, I will begin to explore a new one.

Module Madness and Express Routing Challenge need to be updated next. 

Updated Weekend 3: Calculator over the weekend. Need to ask why clicking in the fields kick off an error but still will put the numbers entered into an object. 

Working on Favorite Pet API: Finally got pets to show up on DOM by actually closing the <select tag>

Next: post pets to database...

Both controllers are working. Need to fix $scope error. 

Weekend 5 complete and sent to instructors. . Sent Weekend 4 to instructors for review. 

Reviewd weekend 4 and 5 with Danny. Two Assessments to redo. 

Beginning of Pi. Will continue to explore Angular. React next. 

#Derek Banas-Angular Intro

Modules: represent components in application-easier to resue code in other apps. 

Directives: allows you to bind data to html elements. 

Scope: data generated on the server or client side using JS code. allows for data binding Scope = data
  When data changes on the html side it will change on the model side. When it changes on the model side
  it will change on the html side == two way data binding. 


Model, View, Whatever: 
Model = data e.g. var firstname = "Dave";
View: = html e.g. <h1>Dave</h1>

The Model and the View are bound. 



With Angular when you build an app, there are elements that don't pollute the global namespace. 
    variables and functions don't collide and contradict variables and functions written elsewhere. 
    Committed. 
    
    
    Getting to the point where I may have to deelete this repo because it's embarassing. Still learning and doing solid work though.
