#Git Hub Challenge Goals

For my github challenge I will be reinforcing my JavaScript and jQuery skills because they still need to be developed. I will be updating existing Prime assignments that are incomplete or need updating. 

If after I feel like I have a better handle on these two languages, I will begin to explore a new one.

Module Madness and Express Routing Challenge need to be updated next.
