#Git Hub Challenge Goals

For my github challenge I will be reinforcing my JavaScript and jQuery skills because they still need to be developed. I will be updating existing Prime assignments that are incomplete or need updating. 

If after I feel like I have a better handle on these two languages, I will begin to explore a new one.

Module Madness and Express Routing Challenge need to be updated next. 

Updated Weekend 3: Calculator over the weekend. Need to ask why clicking in the fields kick off an error but still will put the numbers entered into an object. 

Working on Favorite Pet API: Finally got pets to show up on DOM by actually closing the <select tag>

Next: post pets to database...

Both controllers are working. Need to fix $scope error.
